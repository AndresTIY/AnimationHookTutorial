### Description

I needed more practice creating and understanding custom hooks. I have a, let's say, intermediate understanding of using hooks such as `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, and also reducer hooks such as `useDispatch` and `useSelector` but this small tutorial should be able to help me seperate my hook components and write cleaner/easier to read code.

Also I would love to spend some time learning more about Animations so this helped as well!
